/*
 *course: CS218-00x
 *Project: Lab 11
 *Purpose: create a graph from given set of vertices and edges
 *         repeatedly ask the user to choose a source vertex, then a destination vertex (enter "Q" or "q" to quit)
 *         and calculate the shortest distance from the source to the destination
 *         then display the shortest path from the destination back to the source
