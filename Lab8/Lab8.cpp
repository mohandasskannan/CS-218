/*
 * Course: CS218-00x
 * Project: Lab 8 (as part of Project 2)
 * Purpose: use the Card and  Deck classes to display 
 *          the 5 cards in user's hand in descreasing order by card points
 *          Note the suit of a card has NO impact on the order
 *          A (=14) has higher point than all other cards, J = 11, Q = 12, K = 13
 *          1 point is not used in the card 
 *          then based on the highest point card in the user's hand
 *          use the Rank class to display all possible hand rankings from highest to lowest
