/*
 *Course: CS218-00x
 *Project: Lab5 (As the first part of Project1)
 *Purpose: As part of the Project 1,
 *         to test if the definition of Gradebook class is correct.
 *         it provides FOUR "hard-coded" testing cases of expected average
 *            to curve the scores based on each expected average.
 *         each student's score is at the range [0,100]
 *         the expected average is at the range (original average, 100]
 *
